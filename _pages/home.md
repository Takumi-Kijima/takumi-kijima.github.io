### About Me

I am a PhD student in Mathematical Sciences at Rutgers University Newark working with <a href="https://patrickshafto.com/">Prof. Patrick Shafto</a> at <a href="https://shaftolab.com/">Shafto Lab</a> since September 2024.

Previously, I worked on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under sequential social dilemmas with Dr. Taro Toyoizumi at the <a href="https://toyoizumilab.riken.jp/">Lab for Neural Computation and Adaptation</a> at <a href="https://cbs.riken.jp/en/">RIKEN Center for Brain Science</a> from May 2022 until August 2024.
Additionally, I worked on fMRI data analysis with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jlB0TpIAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Junichi Chikazoe</a> at <a href="https://research.araya.org/">Araya Inc.</a> from December 2021 until August 2024.

Prior to that, I studied for an MS in Statistics and worked as a Teaching Assistant at Miami University from August 2019 to May 2021. I received my BS in Mathematics from Ohio Northern University in 2019.
